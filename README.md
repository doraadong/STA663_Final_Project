# Implementing Canonical Baum-Welch and Viterbi Algorithms for Hidden Markov Model to Generate Synthetic DNA Sequences

Our project reviews a selected bioinformatics academic paper on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with focus on the implementation of canonical Viterbi, forward-backward and Baum-Welch Algorithms in Python on simulated and real data. We further explore the options of codes optimization discussed in the capstone course STA 663 Statistical Computation, including the discussion of better algorithms and data structures, the JIT compilation of critical functions, vectorization and parallelism.

Please review `Project_Writeup.pdf` for details about the project and the folder `linearhmm` for all functions and optimization codes. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Installation of `numpy` and `pytest` are required prior to the package `linearhmm`.


### Installing

The codes are compiled as package `linearhmm`. To download the package, simply run `python setup.py install. linearhmm`. 


## Running the tests

Two automated tests are given under the folder of `linearhmm` (test_HMMchain.py	and test_utils.py).
